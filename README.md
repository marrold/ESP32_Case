This is my first attempt at making a laser cut "case" for an ESP32 Dev module. There are versions with and without engraved numbers. The "notch" is an attempt to not cover the onboard antenna however I'm well aware it probably makes negligble difference. There are also (optional) holes to expose the Enable and Boot buttons, although these were omitted in the images.

This is currently a work in progress so your mileage may vary.

## Images
